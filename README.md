Welcome to the people blogs website, source code!
This is a project I made almost fully on my own. 

DESCRIPTION
  This website is a social website, it allows multiple users at once, the users can message eachother.
  In the website you can create blogs (currently 2 per user) and on these blogs you can post anything you like! Pictures, stories, videos even all together.
  There is a comment section for each post, and there is a viewing system which shows how many people read your blogs and posts.
  Of course there is a profile page, which you can edit your details, and have a sum of all your user work.
  The password are kept hashed and salted, so don't be worried (but always try and use strong passwords).
  There is a detection system that wont let you exit a page in the middle writing a blog or a post, so you wont accidently delete all your progress.
  Of course there is a warning system for deleting posts and blogs.
  You can contact me on the website if you would like.

Why did I took this project upon myself? 
  I started this project, because I fell in love with full stack development. I have a unique curiousity, which anytime I meet something new, makes me take on HUGE projects.
  I also love designing projects. I designed this website to be unique, and to be my own, I didn't copy any designs from other websites.

How did I design the website?
  Well, I worked purely on what I call: idea -> let's try, basis. Each time I had an idea, without having any clue on how, I tried to create it.
  This 'basis' made my capabilities evolve over time. 
  I first started by just typing code, until the idea worked. then I learned to use google and youtube to help.
  Then I learned to plan ahead, by first drawing a scheme of how the idea should look like and work.
  Then I learned to write organized code, after this I decided to go and painstakingly change ALL the code and organize it.
  It took almost 5 whole days to reorganize the code (JS in the MVC Pattern and turn the Flask code to be modular).

Any hardships?
  MANY, so much, I can't remember all of them.
